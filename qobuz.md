# Bandcamp Privacy Policy

_Last reviewed: 2016-12-18_

__Important note:__ this service's privacy policy doesn't cover all details we'd like. This review may be innacurate.

__tl;dr__ Qobuz:

- collects some basic information.
- _may_ share some information in order to operate, but not beyond that.
- _will not_ share or sell your information to third parties that aren't relevant for it to operate.
- _appears to not_ use aggressive/pervasive tracking.
- _does not_ keep your data after you delete your account.
- _appears to not_ be working with data brokers.

Note that you may register using some false information.

Note that as a Premium user you share payment information.

## Information they collect

- Qobuz claims it won't collect identifying information unless explicitly. This suggests it doesn't get information except if you're asked directly.
- to create an account: username, email, password, birthdate, sex (including non-binary); some of this information may be false
- you may add more information to your profile, including contacts
- to pay/become premium: ???; the privacy policy doesn't specify, but they use payment processors, so there will be some sharing and collection of personal information
- not specified, but likely: your purchase history (if you buy music from them)
- information gathered via analytics, including information collected by the third party providers of those services; this includes technical information about your browser and device, your IP address, cookie information, the pages you request, some geographical information, ISP, etc.

## What they share and how

- Bandcamp uses third party analytics, including Google Analytics, so they automatically share some information about you; these services also collect information of their own, and you're bound to their privacy policies.

## What you can do about these rules

- You are not required to provide some of the information the service could collect. This includes profile information you don't fill out. You can also use false information.
- "In accordance with ... the French Law", you can access, modify, correct, and delete your personal information. You can contact them by [email](mailto:qobuz@qobuz.com) or post to do any of those things. You can also change some of your information via the service.

## Pervasive tracking

- Information shared with third party analytics is usually non-identifying, but Qobuz doesn't specify what it sends. However, this information can be used to fingerprint you, i.e. know that it's you by combining it with other things known about you, your device, and/or your habits.
- Qobuz lets you delete your personal information if you quit the service.
- Because you need an account to become a premium user, your history of using it may be part of their records.
