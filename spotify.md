# Spotify Privacy Policy (PP)

_Last reviewed: 2016-12-18_

__tl;dr__ Spotify:

- collects too much information
- shares information too readily
- uses aggressive/pervasive tracking
- uses shady practices to access and share your information
- forces you to forfeit some rights and protections of your data
- _is working_ with data brokers ðŸ”¥

## Information they "must have":

- name
- birth date
- address
- email
- sex
- "broad, non-specific" location, based on your IP address
- the music you listen to (for recommendations)
- technical and sensor information (type of browser and device, touchscreen data, accelerometer and gyroscope data)

## Information they can have, if you provide it (but it's not necessary)

"... information that enables us to offer you additional features."

- specific location (as accurate as possible)
- photos you send them (e.g. profile picture)
- list of contacts (to "find friends or contacts who use Spotify")
- microphone (e.g. "to control Spotify with your voice")

## What they share

- if you sign up through Facebook, some information is shared between the two services
- "de-identified information" is shared with "music industry partners to help them understand how the content they license to us is performing"
- some information is shared with "marketing partners"
- some information is shared with "advertisers that allow us to offer a free service"
- data you make public in the service, is shared with all users
- if you allow it, some of your information may be shared with artists and/or labels (making them able to contact you directly)
- if you allow it, some of your information may be shared with your contacts and friends, people you follow or that follow you
- if you sign up "through an offer that you received or purchased from a third party" (e.g. mobile network operator), some of your information is shared with that third party
- if Spotify undergoes a merger or acquisition, your information automatically goes to the new entity
- Spotify may share information in response to a legal process (e.g. a court order)
- Spotify may share information to comply with the law
- Spotify may share information to protect the safety of any person
- Spotify may share information to protect its own rights and property
- Spotify may share information to "address fraud, security, or technical issues"
- "de-identified" information may be shared with academic researchers (for analysis and study)
- "de-identified or aggregate" information may be shared to publish data about how Spotify is being used

## What you consent to

All of the above, plus:

- their use of cookies and similar technologies
- "the transfer of your information outside the country where you live"
- if you register through Facebook, they may access a far greater trove of information (including hometown, friends, etc.)
- the collection and usage of a "unique device ID", device attributes, and similar
- the collection and usage of "information enabling digital rights management" (DRM)
- that Spotify may identify and track you on websites that use the Spotify widget
- if you pay for the service, your payment method and related information (postal code, phone number, etc.) is stored by Spotify and the payment processors they work with
- Spotify may share anything about you with other companies in the Spotify group, trusted business partners, and service providers
- you waive your rights to local banking secrecy laws
- you accept that your information will be stored in countries that provide less privacy protections than yours
- if you take part in "sweepstakes, contests, offers, and/or surveys" or similar, there may be a different Privacy Policy and TCU applicable
- Spotify may get information about you from service providers and partners

## What's always public

- name and/or username
- profile picture
- who you follow
- who follows you
- your Spotify user profile

Some or all of this information is "always publicly available", including through their APIs and similar tools. This makes this information available to additional third parties.

## What you can do about these rules

- if you delete your account, some or all of the parts of this privacy are cancelled
- if you have questions, you can email [privacy@spotify.com](mailto:privacy@spotify.com)
- you can also contact Spotify via letter
- it may be possible to request a list of all the information Spotify has about you
- if Spotify changes their PP, they may not notify you; Spotify claims it depends on whether they are "material changes"
- if the PP changes, and your consent is needed to continue using the service, not accepting the new PP means the service is cancelled

## Pervasive tracking

Apart from the vast amount of information Spotify may collect on you, they resort to what we call pervasive tracking:

- Spotify uses both session and persistent cookies
- Spotify uses third party analytics providers
- Spotify uses third party advertising providers, with corresponding tracking and cookies
- Third parties may be given access to some or all of these cookies
- Spotify uses mobile device identifiers (such as a device's unique ID)
- Spotify does not respect or respond to Do Not Track (DNT) requests
- Spotify uses your information for behavioral analytics and advertising
- Using Spotify forces you to consent to the use of Google Analytics and DoubleClick (indirectly), including their cookies and privacy policies
