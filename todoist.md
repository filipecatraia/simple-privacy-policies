# Todoist account Privacy Policy

_Last reviewed: 2016-12-18_

__tl;dr__ Regarding registed users, Todoist:

- collects some basic information.
- obviously collects the information you submit to the app (such as tasks).
- _may_ share some information in order to operate, but not beyond that.
- _will not_ share or sell your information to third parties that aren't relevant for Todoist to operate.
- _will not_ claim rights to the data you submit to the app.
- _appears to not_ use aggressive/pervasive tracking.
- _does not_ specify if they keep your data after you delete your account.
- _appears to not_ be working with data brokers.

Note that you may register using false information.

Note that as a Premium user you share payment information.

## Information they collect

- When you create an account, Todoist collects your name, email, and password.
- If you're a Premium user, Todoist may "store your PayPal email and mobile phone number."
- Todoist collects emails "of those who communicate with [them]".
- Information you provide voluntarily by using the service may be collected.
- If you participate in surveys, the information you provide may be collected.
- "Todoist also collects aggregated, anonymous user data regarding app usage."
- Evidently, all information you provide the service to use it. That means your tasks, deadlines, etc.
- Todoist does not appear to collect information about you from third parties.

## What they share and how

"Todoist uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run Todoist. Although Todoist owns the code, databases, and all rights to the Todoist application, you retain all rights to your data. We will never share your personal data with a 3rd party without your prior authorization, and we will never sell data to 3rd parties."

- As usual, Todoist has to store and transmit data in order to work.
- We found no third party trackers when using the web app, as a logged-in user. However, the macOS app attempts to connect to Google-owned domains. This suggests Google may be a third party in the relationship.
- Todoist does not appear to use ads or advertising networks.

## What you can do about these rules

- You need an account to use the service, but may provide false registration information.
- If the privacy policy is updated, you may not be notified directly (such as over email).
- If you think Todoist isn't respecting its policy, you may contact them.

## Pervasive tracking

The apps make requests to domains beyond those of Todoist, so we can't know for sure if you're being tracked by third parties. Also, remember that data about your devices and connection may be enough to fingerprint you. That said, it appears Todoist itself doesn't use pervasive tracking.
